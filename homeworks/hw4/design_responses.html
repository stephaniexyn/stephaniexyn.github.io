						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about tools for maintaining accessible contrasts and keeping track of color palettes.
									It's really interesting how mathematical design can be, and I like how there are tools to quanitify the
									accessibility of a design. The ability to add patterns to colors is also really interesting and definitely
									something I haven't known before reading the article.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really enjoyed how the article treats accessibility as something that should be considered by every designer,
								and it reminds me of a previous article we read that discusses how a successful website should serve its audience. 
								I especially appreciate that the author linked the actual tools he uses to help more designers implement accessibility
								into their own projects. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Also, not creating accessible products is just rude, so donâ€™t be rude. </p>
