							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that font pairing is effective in establishing hierarchy. 
								Moreover, there are golden ratios for scaling font sizes, which I wasn't aware of before.
								I have always considered picking fonts to be a subjective experience, but it seems that
								there is quite a lot of science to it as well. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really enjoyed the discussion on empathizing with the website's intended audience.
									It's really interesting that different typography are created to tailor to different audiences.
									It's easy to always consider that the audience is someone who has similar tastes to you, but that
									may not always be the case in the industry.  </p>
