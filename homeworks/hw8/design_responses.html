				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I didn't realize the variety of dark patterns that existed despite always coming across them.
                            I also think it's interesting that similar topics were discussed in my computer security class, and it
                            seems that web deveopment is really an interdisciplinary field. It's good to be aware of these patterns to
                            avoid falling victim to the tricks employed by corporations.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> It's interesting how many different ways there are for coporations to artifically inflate their sales.
                            I think the way UX design bleeds into politics is espcially interesting and concerning. It seems that people
                            easily trust content online that seems "legit", which allows fake media and information to become rampant.
                            I think this issue can be worsened by the emergence of AI, as AI generated content has already began to pollute
                            real documentation and image collections. </p>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> I believe that as user experience designers we need to think beyond providing aesthetics and usability to our users.  </p>
