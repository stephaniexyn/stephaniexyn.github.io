                            <p> It seems that a large component of a successful design lies in having a responsive UI.
                                Being able to interact with elements on the page makes the experience much more immersive and fun.
                                By keeping the page dynamic, users are probably more likely to spend time on the website as the 
                                experience is enriching and satisfying. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I really enjoyed the variety of examples provided in the article, as it gave me a good overview of the 
                                different possibilities a UI design can take on. It was also interesting to observe the similarities between the good
                                designs, such as the clean color schemes and fluid animations. It is definitly inspiring to see what is possible in 
                                UI design.

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I especially liked the Add to Cart Interaction by Dannniel for Norde. The animation of showing and hiding the item details feel fluid
                                and bouncy, which I find pleasant to look at. The fading in and out of different color options makes the shopping experience more visually interesting,
                                and it feels as if you are customizing the shoes rather than simply choosing. Aside from the animations, the limited color palette of the interface is
                                easy to look at, with the splash of color introduced by the animations adding a hint of personality to the otherwise minimalist design.</p>
