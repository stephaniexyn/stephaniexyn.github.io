						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that asymmetric motion can help draw attention to an object's destination, which was not something I was aware
                of before. The discussion on combining curvature movement with asymmetric motion also made me realize the 
                It's really interesting how much psychology there is behind UX design, and how seemingly similar animations can produce
                very different experiences. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part is when they explained the different curves that can be used to enhance the animations. By using different examples
                  the article made it clear what each curve was doing, which was really helpful. They also explained the basic principle underlying the curves,
                  which helps me understand how the curves work in general. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface. </p>
