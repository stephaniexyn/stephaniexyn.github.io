							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> It's interesting how design is such an interdisplinary field since psychological principles can also be applied. 
                  I think we are all aware of how humans can see patterns and faces among random objects, but it's cool to learn about
                  the vocabulary that describes it. I think the principles of proximity and closure have the most effect in this regard. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked how each of the principles was explained in detail, and the use of quotes at the beginning of the article also
                  piqued my interest. The graphics related to the psychological principles are also interesting to look at. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
